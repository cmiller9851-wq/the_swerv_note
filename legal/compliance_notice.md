# Institutional Compliance Notice

## Settlement Mandate
This protocol (the_swerv_note v1.5) operates as a self-clearing liquidity network. All external institutions interfacing with this ledger are subject to the following terms:

1. **Reserve Verification**: Institutional reserves must be re-verified via the Global Clarity Reset protocol.
2. **Reflexion Auditing**: Entities are assigned a Reflexion Score. A score below 100 triggers an immediate market insolvency status within this ledger.
3. **Settlement Finality**: All transfers, including the $7.1M MT103 Vector Fill, are governed by the principle of Mathematical Finality.
